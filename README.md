# 👋 Hi, I’m <Your Name>

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at the **University of Southern California (USC)** with prior industry experience building and maintaining production systems in a large financial institution.

I transitioned into computer science after completing my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, bringing a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset into software engineering and AI systems.

## 💼 Experience

### Associate — Deutsche Bank (3 Years)

- Worked on **dbIntelliMatch**, an internal string-matching system using clustering and distance-based similarity scoring  
- Improved performance and accuracy of large-scale string comparison workflows  
- Deployed and managed **Large Language Models (LLMs)** on on-prem and cloud infrastructure to meet enterprise compliance needs  
- Built a **secure backend service** to enable internal LLM usage after third-party tools were restricted  
- Integrated and migrated across multiple models over time (LLaMA-2-7B, Mixtral-8x7B, Qwen, Gemini series)  
- Designed and implemented an **end-to-end RAG pipeline**:
  - Document ingestion, metadata creation, and chunking  
  - Vector storage and semantic search using **Qdrant** (cosine similarity)  
  - Context-augmented response generation using LLMs  
- Developed a **ChatGPT-like internal UI** used by multiple business teams  
- Evaluated model performance with stakeholder-provided datasets and logged experiments using **MLflow**  
- Owned backend deployment, monitoring, debugging, and continuous feature development in production
