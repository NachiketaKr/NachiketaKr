 # 👋 Hey hey!! Thanks for stopping by

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at the **University of Southern California (USC)** with prior industry experience building and maintaining production systems in a large financial institution.

I transitioned into computer science after completing my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, bringing a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset into software engineering and AI systems.
