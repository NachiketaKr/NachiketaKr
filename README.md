# 👋 Hi, I’m Nachiketa Kumar

I’m a Computer Science graduate student at the **University of Southern California (USC)** with prior industry experience building and maintaining production systems in a large financial institution.

I transitioned into computer science after completing my undergraduate studies in Mechanical Engineering, bringing a strong analytical and problem-solving mindset into software engineering and AI systems.

## 💼 Experience

### Associate — Deutsche Bank (3 Years)

- Worked on **dbIntelliMatch**, an internal string-matching system using clustering and distance-based similarity scoring  
- Improved performance and accuracy of large-scale string comparison workflows  

- Deployed, monitored, and maintained **LLM services on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
- Built backend services in **Python** using **FastAPI** to expose secure APIs for internal users  
- Managed **cloud deployments, monitoring, and incident handling** for production LLM systems  

- Integrated and migrated across multiple Large Language Models:
  - LLaMA-2-7B  
  - Mixtral-8x7B  
  - Qwen models  
  - Gemini (1.5 Pro → 2 → 2.5 → 3)  

- Designed and implemented an **end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline** using **LangChain**:
  - Document ingestion, metadata creation, and chunking  
  - Vector embedding generation and semantic search using **Qdrant** (cosine similarity)  
  - Context-aware response generation with LLMs  

- Developed a **ChatGPT-like internal UI** used by multiple business teams (NFRM, Treasury, MVRM)  
- Evaluated model outputs using stakeholder-provided datasets and logged experiments using **MLflow**  

- Used **MongoDB** for storing application data and configurations  
- Managed **secrets, API keys, and access controls** for internal users using **GCP services**  
- Owned backend lifecycle: feature development, production rollout, monitoring, and debugging
